        <li><strong>MIS 315:</strong> <em>Business Data Stream and Issues</em>: Develop methods of data access, collection, and sharing. Develop methods to validate and standardize data sources; develop methods to assess data worthiness (risk).</li>
        <li><strong>MIS 320:</strong> <em>Database Management Systems</em>: Database design, developement, and implementation. Focusing on data models, both classical and object oriented. Uses relational and/or object oriented database management systems. <strong>Final Project</strong>: create an ERD diagram about an on campus club and then implement it into an SQL database schema and have it answer queries about questions regrading the clubs operations.</li>
        <li><strong>MIS 436:</strong> <em>Introduction to Business Analytics</em>: Practice examining business analytics processes and techniques used in transforming data to knowledge and creating value for organizations. Business cases, presentations by business professionals, class lectures and dicussions on data analysis, design and modeling, and extensive hands-on analytical exercises. RapidMiner mastery class.</li>        
        <li><strong>MIS 446:</strong> <em>Advanced Business Analytics</em>: Projects-based course that provides in-depth understanding of business analytics methods of visualization, data mining, text mining, web mining, and predictions through the use of specific business analytics tools. Primarily used RapidMiner during first 2/3s of semester and then switch over to Gephi. <strong>Final Project</strong>: using RapidMiner, take raw csv file and make a prediction using different RandomForest classifier and Cross Validation performance method to predict accuracy of a model we created. Class competition. My accuracy was just below 80% putting me in the top 15 performers in the class.</li>
